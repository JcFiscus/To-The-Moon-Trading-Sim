# QA Smoke Checklist

## Inline trading flow
- [ ] Start day and buy from first asset row; position appears in Portfolio.
- [ ] Up/Down change selected row; Enter buys; Shift+Enter sells; Esc clears selection.

## Layout sanity
- [ ] Three fixed columns (market, chart/details, portfolio/news) fit on 1366Ã—768 without scrolling.
- [ ] Each asset row stays within 44px height and shows ticker lane.

## General
- [ ] All tests pass locally; README reflects single-screen layout.
